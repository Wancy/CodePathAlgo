Design the backend system for the Twitter newsfeed. We want to be able to post tweets, follow other users, and favorite tweets. A user should be able to see a feed of tweets of his/her followers.


Scenario
User post tweets
User follow other users
User favorite tweets
User see a feed of tweets of his/her followers

                 Service

Tweet service                   Friendship Service

Post a tweet                        Follow
News Feed                          Unfollow


Storage
We can use NoSQL database like Apache Cassandra. Using relational database will need a lot of joins operation since a user may have a lot of tweets, followings or followers and in order to get all these information will join different table many times.
We can define two objects, User and Tweet
*User:
id, username, email, password, followings, followers, tweets
*Tweet:
id, content, timestamp, userID


Serve Feed
We can sort the feed from people the user is following by timestamp and show to the user. 
When the user views timeline, will send a request to get the tweets from all his/her followings and sorted by timestamp of the tweet.

Whenever follow, unfollow, post a tweet, add to the corresponding tables. And remove/add to timelines.


Scale
Use cache to speed up the request. For example, cache a few recent tweets of a user.
Load balancer and multi-database instance during peek time.
